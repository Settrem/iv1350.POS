# Point of Sale System – IV1350

This repository contains the code developed for the Point of Sale (POS) system project in the course **IV1350 – Object-Oriented Design** at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**.

## 📌 Overview

The POS system, also known as `CashierSystem`, is a simplified simulation of a real-world point of sale used by retail businesses. The system handles sale transactions, item registration, payment processing, and receipt generation, designed with clean object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and separation of concerns.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply object-oriented design principles in practice
- Create maintainable and extensible code using standard design patterns
- Simulate realistic interactions within a POS system
- Develop a modular system with clearly defined responsibilities

## 🧱 Features

- Start a new sale
- Register scanned items
- Display running totals
- Handle payments and calculate change
- Generate receipts

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- Java
- Standard Java libraries
- Unit testing (JUnit 5)
